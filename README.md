Place the "clamclock" and "demo" folders in your /Documents/Arduino folder to access the sketches we showed you. Place the "hardware" and "libraries" folders in /Documents/Arduino - or add their contents to the folders if they already exist. To program the clock, connect your programmer, under tools, select ATtiny x8 series for the board and ATtiny88 for the chip. Also under tools, select your programmer under programmer (ours was the AVRISP mkII). Then hit upload to upload your sketch.
